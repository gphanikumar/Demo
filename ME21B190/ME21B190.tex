\subsection{Continuity Equation:}

$$\nabla.\vec{V}=0$$


\large\ The countinuity equation describes the trasport of some quantities like fluid or gas.The equation explains how a fluid conserves mass in its motion.
\subsubsection {Momentum Equations:}

$$\frac{d\vec{V}}{dt}=\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + (V.\nabla)V$$
\ Here the total derivative is the sum of change in velocity with time and the convective term
$$\rho\frac{d\vec{V}}{dt}=-\nabla{p} + \rho\vec{g}+\mu\nabla^{2}\vec{V}$$
 *The first term in RHS is the "Pressure gradient term" which tells in which direction the fluid flows

*The second term is the "Body force term",which includes all type of forces
*The third term "Diffusion term"

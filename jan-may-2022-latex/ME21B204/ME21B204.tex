\subsection{EULER'S FORMULA}

$$e^{i\alpha} = \cos\left( \alpha \right) + i\sin\left( \alpha \right)$$
This is a very useful equation in mathematics specially in the area of complex numbers. This equation relates exponents to trigonometry. This enables us to change the domain of our calculations seamlessly. We can use the properties of exponents or we can even use trigonometric properties and solve further.

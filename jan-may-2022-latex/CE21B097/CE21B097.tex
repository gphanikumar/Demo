\begin{equation}
    \boxed{e^{\iota\pi}+1=0}
\end{equation}
\\The equation above is called "\textbf{Euler's identity}". It is named after the Swiss mathematician \textbf{Leonhard Euler}. It's a special case of Euler's formula which is\quad$e^{\iota x}= \cos{x} + \iota\sin{x}$\quad when x = $\pi$. Euler's identity is often cited as an example of deep \textbf{mathematical beauty}. This is because it connects the most fundmental numbers in mathematics e, $\pi$, $\iota$ in a very simple manner. \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\

It is the base of the natural logarithms. It is the limit of (1 + 1/n)n as n approaches infinity                                                        \tabularnewline \hline

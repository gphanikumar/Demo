+ \textbf{Mass-energy equivalence:}
+ \begin{equation}
+        \text{E} = {mc^2}
+        \lable{eqn:E}
+ \end{equation}
+ \[E = mc^2\]
\subsection{Description:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In Physics, mass-energy equivalence is the relationship between mass and energy in a system's rest frame.
    \item The principle is described by the physicist Albert Einstein's famous formula: $E = mc^2$.
    \item It is famous because Its association with one of the most devastating weapons produced by Humans - the atomic bomb.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Table of Variables:}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
     \hline
     \textbf{Variables} & \textbf{Meaning} & \textbf{Units} \\ \hline
     $E$ & Energy & Kg(m/s)^2 \\ \hline
     $m$ & Mass & Kg \\ \hline
     $c^2$ & Speed of light(3*10^8) & (m/s^2) \\ \hline
